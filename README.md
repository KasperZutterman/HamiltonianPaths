# HamiltonianPaths

This javascript program generates Hamiltonian paths on an n × n grid using the backbiting move described in the paper "Secondary structures in long compact polymers" by Richard Oberdorf, Allison Ferguson, Jesper L. Jacobsen and Jané Kondev, Phys. Rev. E 74, 051801 (2006).

The code is based on the implementation of Nathan Clisby: https://clisby.net/projects/hamiltonian_path/hamiltonian_path_v1.html
